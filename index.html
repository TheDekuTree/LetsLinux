                                        The shell is the part of Linux that scares people away. In reality its actually quite simple and if you get really good at it, it's faster than the GUI. The very first thing you should learn in Linux is how to operate the shell. It is the basis of interacting with the OS and is how we will do the majority of software installation.
                                        
                                        <h3 id="basiccommands">Basic Commands:</h3>
                                        
                                            <h4>dir</h4>
                                            This command will list out all of the files and folders in the current directory you are in. For example:
                                            <pre class="prettyprint">
root@hostname:/# dir
bin  boot  dev  etc  home  initrd.img  initrd.img.old  lib  lib64  lost+found  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  snap  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var  vmlinuz  vmlinuz.old
                                            </pre>


                                            <h4>cd "Directory"</h4>
                                            This command will change the directory you are in. For example:
                                            <pre class="prettyprint">
root@hostname:/# cd etc
root@dta:/etc#
                                            </pre>
                                            You are now inside the folder "etc"

                                            <h4>mkdir "name"</h4>
                                            This command will create a new directory (folder). For example:
                                            <pre class="prettyprint">
root@hostname:/# mkdir stuff
                                            </pre>
                                            you just created a folder called "stuff"


                                            <h4>rm "Directory or File"</h4><span class="uk-label uk-label-danger"><span uk-icon="warning"></span></span>
                                            <b>This command will DELETE a file or directory, use with caution. There is no confirmation for this command and using it wrong could delete important system files!</b>
                                            <pre class="prettyprint">
root@hostname:/# rm trash.sh
                                            </pre>
                                            This would delete the file trash.sh

                                            <h4>nano stuff.sh</h4>
                                            Nano is one of the many text editors available for Linux, it may or may not be installed on your system, but in most versions it comes preinstalled. We are using nano for now because it is extremely easy for beginners, Vim is preferred by programmers but we'll touch on that later.  
                                            <pre class="prettyprint">
root@hostname:/# nano stuff.sh
                                            </pre>
                                            You should see something open like this:

                                            <img src="img/nano01.png"></img>

                                            You can type stuff just as you would in something like notepad. You can interact with the editor by using the codes at the bottom of the screen. ^ is the same as CTRL, for example you can save and exit by pressing CTRL-x. 

                                        <h3 id="install">Installing & Updating Software:</h3>

                                        <p class="uk-text-left n-articletext">

                                            Keeping your system up to date is crucial to it performing well and not running into errors. Linux unlike Windows or OSX uses a package manager system, for this example we will use the "apt" package manager which will come installed with a Debian based Linux Distribution. This includes Ubuntu and Stock Debian.

                                        </p>

                                        <p class="uk-text-left n-articletext">
                            
                                            First a bit on what package managers actually do. A package manager is where you will download most of your software from on Linux. Most of the time you won't be downloading binaries from your web browser, you will be installing it via a package manager. Think of the package manager like a giant app store full of open source goodies.
                                            
                                            <h4>sudo "command"</h4>
                                            The sudo command executes a command as root (administrator) even if you are not logged in as root.
                                            <pre class="prettyprint">
someguy@hostname:/# sudo eatallthecookies
you ate the cookies as admin!
                                            </pre>
                                            This is important for our next step, the package manager (apt) requires root permissions so you must run all commands starting with sudo.

                                            <h4>sudo apt update</h4>
                                            This command will download a list of packages from the repository.<br>
                                            <b>NOTE: This command does not update the packages, it just checks the repository for updates!</b>
                                            <pre class="prettyprint">
someguy@hostname:/# sudo apt update
                                            </pre>

                                            <h4>sudo apt upgrade</h4>
                                            This command actually updates the packages you currently have installed. You must run "sudo apt update" before this to check for updated packages.
                                            <pre class="prettyprint">
someguy@hostname:/# sudo apt upgrade
                                            </pre>
                                            When you get back to a normal "someguy@hostname:/#" prompt your update is complete.

                                            <h4>sudo apt install "package name"</h4>
                                            This command will install a package of your choice! Make sure you run "sudo apt update" first if you haven't already.
                                            <pre class="prettyprint">
someguy@hostname:/# sudo apt install nano
                                            </pre>
                                            This will install the text editor "Nano" from the repository.

                                            You can view a list of packages for your Distribution on their website. For now, since we are using Ubuntu/Debian, here is the Ubuntu package repository:
